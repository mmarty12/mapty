#### Web project from "The Complete Javascript Course 2023" (from Udemy)

### This app helps you keep track of your workout progress in a certain location ðŸ“Œ

### Description:

The project implies a loaded from third-party library (Leaflet) map on which you can add your recent workouts. The position of the map is automatically obtained by the browser using your geolocation.

There are two options for workouts:
- running (with additional parameteres like distance, duration, cadence)
- cycling ((with additional parameteres like distance, duration, elevation gain)

After clicking on a map, a popup form appears for you to log the data. Each of the fields is checked on input validity. On pressing "ENTER", the data is written in local storage (so you can access it even after reloading the page), and a pin with brief info popup is fixed in the desired position. If you have activities all over the place, there is no need to manually find a certain workout - you can simply click on its description on the side bar and it will automatically move the map.
